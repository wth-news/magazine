Welcome to Whathehack, your favorite monthly cybersecurity and development
magazine. The first Wednesday of each month on whathehack.com.

In this topic we will talk about tools that help us finding security issues
during the software development lifecycle (SDLC). More specifically,
we will talk about Software Composition Analysis (SCA), Static Application
Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).
